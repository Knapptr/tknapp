[Orca](http://www.hundredrabbits.itch.io/orca) is unique sequencing environment. Created by [Hundred Rabbits](http://100r.co/site/home), a sea-faring development team, Orca is a live-coding environment that sends MIDI (among other) signals.

Orca has massive flexiblity. Combined with a simple midi hub, Orca could sequence an entire setup of hardware.

I created the following piece in late May of 2020. Orca is sending MIDI on 3 channels to the Elektron Digitone. Each channel sends note-on, note value and velocity signals- which are generated with orcas simple-but powerful operators. The 'pine tree' section of Orca here is merely a visualization; no MIDI signals are generated there. Drums are sequenced directly on the remaining channel of the Digitone.
