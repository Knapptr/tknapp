While learning python, I thought it would be helpful to have a script to set up a project and a venv to run in. It proved quite handy. I wrote some (questionable) install scripts for bash to add `ppi` to the system `PATH`. As well.

Just excuse the hideous terminal here:

![ppi example](./images/ppi.gif)

### usage: ppi [-h] directory

Initialize a Python Project. Creates a venv, git, .gitignore, .dotenv. Installs python-
dotenv with pip. Creates a template .py file with logging imported, and set up to DEBUG.

positional arguments:
directory

optional arguments:
-h, --help show this help message and exit

### Notes:

- the install and uninstall scripts are pretty janky. There is probably a better, safer way to do this. For my use, its fine.
